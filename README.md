# Excel-Projects
This is my first Excel project.
I've taken a Bike sales dataset from kaggle and created dashboard to understand the insights of the sales.
First, I've cleaned the data and then created pivot tables and then finally created dashboard using pivot tables.
You can check the original data, cleaned data, pivot tables, and the final dashboard in the Excel sheet.
